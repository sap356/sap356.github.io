Tupacsum Ipsum Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain. And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough. And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever. And even though I act crazy.

We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup. Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain. It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity.

When things went wrong we'd blame mama. Went out and had a church of kids. See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy. Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son.
